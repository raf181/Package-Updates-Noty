# Package Updates Noty - Build & Installation System

## Summary

This project now has a complete build and installation system that works with GitHub repository sources only.

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. `build.sh` - Binary Builder Script
- Creates a standalone binary from the Python script using PyInstaller
- Uses virtual environment to handle externally managed Python environments
- Produces a single executable file in `dist/update-noti`
- Size: ~8.6MB (includes all Python dependencies)

**Usage:**
```bash
./build.sh
```

### 2. `install.sh` - GitHub-Only Installer
- Downloads from GitHub repository only (no local paths)
- Tries binary first from GitHub releases, falls back to Python script
- Sets up systemd timer and cron backup
- Creates configuration files and self-updater

**Usage:**
```bash
# Remote installation
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raf181/Package-Updates-Noty/main/install.sh | sudo bash

# Local testing
sudo bash install.sh
```

## Installation Priority

1. **GitHub Binary** (from releases) - Preferred
2. **GitHub Python Script** (from raw repository) - Fallback

## How It Works

1. **Build Process:**
   - `build.sh` creates virtual environment
   - Installs PyInstaller
   - Compiles Python script to standalone binary
   - Places binary in `dist/update-noti`

2. **Installation Process:**
   - Downloads from GitHub repository
   - Installs to `/opt/update-noti`
   - Sets up systemd timer for daily execution
   - Creates cron backup
   - Tests installation

3. **Auto-Update System:**
   - `update.sh` tries to download latest binary from GitHub releases
   - Falls back to existing installation if download fails
   - Executes the update check

## Current Status

✅ Build script working - creates 8.6MB binary
✅ Installation script working - downloads from GitHub
✅ Python fallback working - uses raw GitHub files
⏳ Binary release needed - for optimal installation experience

## Next Steps

To make the binary installation work optimally:

1. Create a GitHub release
2. Upload the built binary as `update-noti-linux-x86_64`
3. The installer will then prefer the binary over Python script

## Test Results

- ✅ Build process works with virtual environment
- ✅ Binary creation successful (8.6MB)
- ✅ Installation from GitHub repository works
- ✅ Python script fallback works
- ✅ Systemd timer configured
- ✅ Self-updater created
